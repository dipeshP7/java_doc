Cloud : 

services : - IAAS , PAAS, SAAS

deployment models :  private , public hybird



AWS

Deoployment:
ec2:  coumpute -> clean state (new laptop) -> new machine -> need to setup all from base

elastic beanstalk: same as ec2 > diff its contain some predifined liberies


--------------------
Migration :
	move data from one place to another
	
	snowball : like data storage
	
--------------------------

Security 
	IAAM -> authietication 
	KMS -> public and private key
	
----------------------------
Storage :
	s3: bucket
	Glacier -: store archirve

	Direct Connect - least internet connection
	
	#########################
	
EC2 - virutal server -> shared 
	
	Types -> 
		General Purpose instance -> quick response with handling large request 
		compute instance -> high level processing
		memory instance -> heavey in nature, require lots of Ram, multitasking
		storage instance -> more storage, large data
		GPU instance- >  graphical work, 3d
		
		
	pricing :
		on-demand -> require for cetain hour, charge accroding to use like hours , instance terminated after expiry of hour
		dedicated -> not shared by anyone, secure of highy confidential data
		on-spot ->  bidding of instance like share 
		reserved -> renting for long period
	
	General functioning
		Burstable : put some configuration of cup like 20% , if more traffic it will use more cpu at that urgent time ,
					that called burst , will gate credit point to use this.
		EBS optimised : processing data at higher speed
		Cluster Networking: custer of instance
